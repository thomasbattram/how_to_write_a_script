### Outline

* Making a new R script
* Commenting your scripts
* What to think about before starting to script
* How the top of your script should look
* Making your code easier to read
* Saving your scripts

### Making a new R script

* The usual R Studio screen has four windows: 
	+ CONSOLE 
	+ WORKPLCE AND HISTORY 
	+ FILES, PLOTS, PACKAGES AND HELP 
	+ __R SCRIPT AND DATA VIEW__ (this is where you keep a record of your work. For Stata users, this would be like your do-file, for SPSS users it is like the syntax and for SAS users, the SAS program. 

***

``` {r rstudio-full-screen, message=FALSE, results="asis"}
include_graphics(file.path(fig_path, "rstudio-full-screen.pdf"))
```

### Making a new R script

``` {r make-new-r-script, message=FALSE, results="asis"}
include_graphics(file.path(fig_path, "new-r-script.pdf"))
```

### Making a new R script

``` {r script-to-console, message=FALSE, results="asis"}
include_graphics(file.path(fig_path, "script-to-console.pdf"))
```

### Commenting

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
* Code with a # before it does not get run
* This is useful for making your scripts much easier to read! 
* Comment on WHY and WHAT (to start with)
	+ Start with many comments!!!
Also, use comments to split up the script to make it clearer
:::

::: {.column}

``` {r commenting, message=FALSE, results="asis"}
include_graphics(file.path(fig_path, "commenting-example.png"))
```

:::

### 3 steps before starting
1. Why am I writing this script?

<br>

2. What do I need to write this script?

<br>

3. How am I going to write this script? 

### Step 1: Why am I writing this script? 

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
* Think about it and write it down!
	+ e.g. clean a dataset OR assess association between x and y

* Give the script a good name, write a descriptive title + add a couple of lines that describe the purpose of the script
:::

::: {.column}

``` {r title, message=FALSE, results="asis"}
include_graphics(file.path(fig_path, "title-example.png"))
```

:::
::::::

### Step 2: What do I need to write this script?

* Datasets!

* Using only base R can make things difficult... Packages! 
* Packages are made by others and are there to make your life easier

<br>

For example, reading data into R can be tricky depending on how the data is stored, but packages can make this easier! 

### Reading data into R

Depending on what form the data is in, you have to use different functions to read in the data. Data you get may be in:

* excel spreadsheets
* comma seperated value (csv) files 
* text separated value (tsv) files
* spss files
* stata files
* images (e.g. .png files)

These need different functions to read them in, some of which are only available with certain packages – will be covered in more detail in the "managing data” session. 

``` {r package-example, message=FALSE, results="asis"}
include_graphics(file.path(fig_path, "package-example.png"))
```

### Step 3: How am I going to write this script? 

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
* Linked to why you are writing it and what you need to write it! 

<br>
 
* Write out each step
:::

::: {.column}

``` {r instructions-example, message=FALSE, results="asis"}
include_graphics(file.path(fig_path, "structure-example.png"))
```

:::
::::::

### Top of the script
``` {r top-of-script, message=FALSE, results="asis"}
include_graphics(file.path(fig_path, "top-of-script.png"))
```

### Make your code easy to read

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
1. Use a consistent style when writing code

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

2. Use spaces appropriately
:::

::: {.column}

``` {r hard-to-read-code, message=FALSE, results="asis"}
include_graphics(file.path(fig_path, "hard-to-read-code.png"))
```

:::
::::::

### Saving scripts

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
* It's important to save scripts as you go and you can always come back to them and send them to other people.

<br>

* Give the script a good name and save it regularly! 
:::

::: {.column}

``` {r save-script, message=FALSE, results="asis"}
include_graphics(file.path(fig_path, "save-script.png"))
```

:::

### Summary 

3 questions to think about before writing a script:

1. Why am I writing this script?
2. What do I need to write this script?
3. How am I going to write this script? 

<br>

* Comment your code a lot (using #)
* Make your code easy to read
* Save your scripts regularly

### Git

* One way to share scripts with the world (or just your collaborators) is through [GitHub](https://github.com/).

* Slides are available here: https://github.com/thomasbattram/how_to_write_a_script
